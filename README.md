# LBI-Base
Hello thanks for checking this out. Here is a basic example of using a LBI to achieve basic script execution. You can also check out [this LBI base](https://github.com/Nihon-Development/Nihon-Lua-Bytecode-Interperter) written by one of my friends that was based off this one. 

Also this is the shittiest c++ code you will ever see.

NOTE: Build in Release x86
